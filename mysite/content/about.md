I am Adarsh, a Research Fellow in the Department of Political Sciences at University College London. My work involves designing and developing agent-based models for the Human Rights Nudge Project, collaborating across law, social sciences, behavioral sciences, and informatics. The project focuses on understanding mechanisms within the international court of human rights, encompassing compliance, decision-making systems, vulnerabilities, and potential remedies.

Previously, I was a doctoral student (thesis submitted) at the University of Edinburgh's Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute, School of Informatics. My research focused on designing and implementing agent-based models that incorporate complex socio-economic and behavioural factors to simulate the impact of spatial and network-based tobacco control policies.

I completed my Integrated BS-MS with Majors in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali, where I gained a strong foundation in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology.

My research interests are in modelling socio-political systems, AI for societal good, and developing models for policy making.
